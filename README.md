<!-- ![TodoList App Screenshot](todo_app_screenshot.png) -->

## Features

The TodoList React App allows users to:

- Create new todo items with a title and description.
- View a list of all existing todo items.
- Delete todo items when they are completed or no longer needed.

## How to Install

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. You can download Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org

2. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clonehttps://github.com/MoeadRehan/todolist.git


3. Change the current directory to the root of the cloned repository:


cd todolist


4. Install the required dependencies for the app by running the following command:

npm install


## How to Run

1. Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server by running the following command:

npm start


2. Your default web browser should automatically open the TodoList app at `http://localhost:3000/`. If it doesn't, you can manually open that URL in your browser.

3. Now you can start using the TodoList app to create, read, and delete todos!

## Usage

- To create a new todo, click on the "Add Todo" button and fill in the title and description of the task. Click "Save" to add the new todo to the list.
- To mark a todo as completed or delete a todo, click on the corresponding buttons next to the todo item in the list.
- The app will automatically update the list in real-time as you add or delete todos.
